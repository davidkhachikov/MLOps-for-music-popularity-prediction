## Data Configuration (`main.yaml`)

This YAML file sets up the dataset for the music popularity prediction project, detailing how to access and manage both remote and local versions of the data.

### Overview
- **Data Remote**: Specifies the version, path, repository, DVC remote name, and sample size for the remote dataset.
