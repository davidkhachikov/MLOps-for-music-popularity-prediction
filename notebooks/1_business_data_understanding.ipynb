    "This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources,constraints, assumptions and other factors that should be considered in determining the data analysis goal and project plan. In the previous task, your objective is to quickly get to the crux of the situation. Here, you want to flesh out the details.\n",

    "#### 2. Requirements, assumptions and constraints\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 3. Risks and contingencies \n",
    "\n",
    "List the risks or events that might occur to delay the project or cause it to fail. List the corresponding contingency plans; what action will be taken if the risks happen.\n",

    "#### 4. Costs and benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a cost-benefit analysis for the project, which compares the costs of the project with the potential benefit to the business if it is successful. The comparison should be as specific as possible.\n",

Where possible, try and make explicit the large-scale iterations in the machine learning process, for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases. As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks are manifested. Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase. Your project plan will be a dynamic document. At the end of each phase you’ll review progress and achievements and update the project plan accordingly. Specific review points for these updates should be part of the project plan.\n",
