    "## Project feasibility \n",
    "-------------\n",
    "This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all of the resources,constraints, assumptions and other factors that should be considered in determining the data analysis goal and project plan. In the previous task, your objective is to quickly get to the crux of the situation. Here, you want to flesh out the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### tasks\n",
    "- Assess the project feasibility\n",
    "- Create POC (Proof-of-concept) model\n",
    "\n",
    "### output\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. inventory of resources\n",
    "\n",
    "List the resources available to the project, including: personnel (business experts, data experts, technical support, machine learning personnel), data (fixed extracts, access to live warehoused or operational data), computing resources (hardware platforms) and software (machine learning tools, other relevant software).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Requirements, assumptions and constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "List all requirements of the project including schedule of completion, comprehensibility and quality of results and security as well as legal issues.As part of this output, make sure that you are allowed to use the data. List the assumptions made by the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "These may be assumptions about the data that can be checked during machine learning, but may also include non-checkable assumptions about the business upon which the project rests. It is particularly important to list the latter if they form conditions on the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "List the constraints on the project. These may be constraints on the availability of resources, but may also include technological constraints such as the size of data that it is practical to use for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Risks and contingencies \n",
    "\n",
    "List the risks or events that might occur to delay the project or cause it to fail. List the corresponding contingency plans; what action will be taken if the risks happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Costs and benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Construct a cost-benefit analysis for the project, which compares the costs of the project with the potential benefit to the business if it is successful. The comparison should be as specific as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/XU2lghc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Feasibility report\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a POC ML model and explain as a team whether it is feasible to do this ML project or not. If not, then you need to find another business problem. They key factors here are related to data availability, quality, costs and nature of business problem."

    "#### 1. Project plan\n",
    "List the stages to be executed in the project, together with their duration, resources required, inputs, outputs, and dependencies. Where possible, try and make explicit the large-scale iterations in the machine learning process, for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases. As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks are manifested. Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase. Your project plan will be a dynamic document. At the end of each phase you’ll review progress and achievements and update the project plan accordingly. Specific review points for these updates should be part of the project plan.\n",
