# Notebooks
This section provides an overview of the Jupyter notebooks included in the project, detailing their purpose and functionality within the context of the MLOps for Music Popularity Prediction project.


`1_business_data_understanding.ipynb`

**Description:** This notebook conducts an in-depth analysis of the music popularity prediction business problem and the analyzed dataset. It explores data distributions, tests hypotheses, and develops a proof-of-concept model to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. This foundational work is crucial for informing subsequent steps in the project, such as feature engineering and model development.


`feature_engineering.ipynb`

**Description:** Dedicated to exploring the dataset, this notebook focuses on identifying and creating relevant features that could influence music popularity. It involves a detailed examination of the dataset to uncover hidden insights and relationships between variables. The goal is to transform raw data into informative features that can improve the performance of predictive models. Techniques employed may include statistical analysis, visualization, and domain-specific knowledge to engineer meaningful features.


`feature_expectations.ipynb`

**Description:** This notebook is responsible for generating Great Expectations (GX) for features. Great Expectations is a tool used for validating and documenting data assets. In this context, it ensures that the features used in the model meet specific quality standards and expectations. By defining these expectations, the notebook helps maintain data integrity and reliability throughout the project, especially during the transition from development to production environments. It specifies what each feature should look like, including its distribution, missing values, and other characteristics, providing a clear standard for data quality.


`validation_expectations.ipynb`

**Description:** Focused on the Apache Airflow pipeline, this notebook generates expectations on the data processed through the pipeline. It ensures that the data transformations and manipulations performed within the pipeline adhere to predefined quality standards. This step is critical for maintaining data quality and consistency across different stages of the MLOps workflow, from data ingestion to model deployment. By validating the data at each stage, the notebook helps identify and rectify issues early, contributing to more reliable and accurate predictions.
